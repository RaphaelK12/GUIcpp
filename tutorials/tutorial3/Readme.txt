Description:

	Learn how to render an OpenGL scene using the surface of one

        OnMouseUp, OnKeyDown and OnKeyUp.


    	After compiling you will be able to:

	Zoom the cylinder in and out holding the SHIFT key pressed and moving the mouse.
	Rotate the cylinder moving the mouse.
	Translate the cylinder with the arrow keys.
