# GUIcpp
An OpenGL user interface written in C++ some time ago. It is not maintained anymore, but it's here for reference.

# Details
The project was portable and could be compiled on both Windows and Linux platforms. The class structure follows very close the famous Borland C++ Builder UI controls. The graphics engine is loose coupled with the controls and the interface can be used in stand alone applciations or inserted in existing game engines.

# History
The project's goal was to allow developers to create OpenGL UIs that looked similar to the desktop versions like OSX.

# Compatibility
Windows / Linux

# Licence
